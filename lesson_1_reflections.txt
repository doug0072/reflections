ways to compare files:
	windows - FC
	unix - diff

	
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug 
that was introduced?
	It pinpoints the differences.
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a 
more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It will save time when editing and debugging.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create 
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like 
Google Docs does?
	Pros: can keep changes organized logically.
	Cons: might forget to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving 
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each 
file separately?
	Depends on their scope; programming often requires multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of 
files?
	log: shows the list of changes with the key id'save
	diff: allows comparison of two changes by entering the key id's

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes 
that could break something?
	It's easy to revert back to before the error was created.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using 
Git for?
	My android course.
